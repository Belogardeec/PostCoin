# PostCoin[Post]
 Postcoin in association with The Altcoinboard forum launches the official currency of the first revenue sharing altcoin forum. The forum allows you to earn tokens for every post you make and then exchange them in the forum's Exchange Center into PostCoins. Postcoin is distributed initially for free between Bitcointalk members based on their postcount to the date of application.
 
        The forum's revenue will be generated by several forms of ads including banner ads, partnership programs, paid/sponsored topics, etc. , however we will do our best not to flood the website with annoying ads, and keep it a friendly discussion board. Payment for the ads will be preferably in PostCoins, but we accept BTC also. In case of BTC payment the forum administrators will immediately exchange the BTC payment into PostCoinm
        
         Postcoin's association with The AltcoinBoard forum brings you a coin that can be spent from day 1, you don't have to wait months or so until it gets to a level when it gets actually usable. The best thing is that you get all these for free, either if you are qualified for the initial distribution, or you become a member of the forum these coins won't cost you a single penny, moreover it's value will be continuously sustained and probably increased by the ad-revenue.
